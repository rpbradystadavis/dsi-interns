Chevalier-2010-Environmental risk factors of W.pdf

1.(solved) section names "METHOLOGY" is seperated by some whitespaces
```
file = "Chevalier-2010-Environmental risk factors of W.pdf"
wholeText = getSectionText(file)
names(wholeText)
```
output:
"METH ODO L OGY" 

possible solution:
gsub() function to ignore all whitespace. 


2. we don't get seroneutralization
reason: word appears in summary section not methodology


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bourhy-2005-Phylogenetic relationships among r.pdf

our output:
PCR,RT-PCR,sequencing
those are in the section "METHOD"
But in forintern2.csv file it shows "IgG ELISA"
We could not find the word "ELISA" or "enzym" in the paper.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Breed-2010-Prevalence of henipavirus and rubul.pdf

our output:
antibodies,ELISA,virus neutralization test,VNT,western blot

forintern:
IgG ELISA,ELISA and VNT,Serology

We don't find igG ELISA in the paper. But we found igM elisa,
the reason why missed it is that it showed up with full name
"immunoglobulin M".

Possible solution: Put full names in our dictionary.

After put immunoglobulin M–specific and immunoglobulin M
we still could not get it because "-" shows up as a weird pattern.
//
Possible solution:
use str_ extract() instead of grep().

Method is not good, because it conflict with previous method, for HI
FA, we want to set word boundary but in this case we broke the rule.
//
possible solutoin:
remove all strange characters

final solution
```
sectionText = gsub("Â", " ", sectionText)
```
