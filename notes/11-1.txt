Chevalier-2010-Environmental risk factors of W.pdf

1.(solved) section names "METHOLOGY" is seperated by some whitespaces
```
file = "Chevalier-2010-Environmental risk factors of W.pdf"
wholeText = getSectionText(file)
names(wholeText)
```
output:
"METH ODO L OGY" 

possible solution:
gsub() function to ignore all whitespace. 


2. we don't get seroneutralization
reason: word appears in summary section not methodology

Bourhy-2005-Phylogenetic relationships among r.pdf

our output:
PCR,RT-PCR,sequencing
those are in the section "METHOD"
"IgG ELISA" is missing.
We could not find the word "ELISA" or "enzym" in the paper.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Breed-2010-Prevalence of henipavirus and rubul.pdf

our output:
antibodies,ELISA,virus neutralization test,VNT,western blot

forintern:
IgG ELISA,ELISA and VNT,Serology

We don't find igG ELISA in the paper. But we found igM elisa,
the reason why missed it is that it showed up with full name
"immunoglobulin M".

Possible solution: Put full names in our dictionary.

After put immunoglobulin M–specific and immunoglobulin M
we still could not get it because "-" shows up as a weird pattern.
//
Possible solution:
use str_ extract() instead of grep().

Method is not good, because it conflict with previous method, for HI
FA, we want to set word boundary but in this case we broke the rule.
//
possible solutoin:
remove all strange characters

final solution
```
sectionText = gsub("Â", " ", sectionText)
```

Buckley-2003-Serological evidence of West Nile.pdf

our output:
"nested pcr"   "PCR"          "PRNT"         "RT-PCR"       "sequencing"   "western blot"

forintern2.csv:
PRNT,Serology, Isolation

In the METHODS section, we get all subtitle words correctly except missing IF test. 
There is "Virus strains" in methods section and we are not sure if
that means "Virus Isolation".

Reason: in the paper it shows up as "immunofluorescence (IF) tests"
But we have immunofluorescence tests in dictionary. (we can add it into
our dictionary)

But we still do not know why they wrote down Serology,
