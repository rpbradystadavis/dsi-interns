our output:
antibodies,ELISA,virus neutralization test,VNT,western blot

forintern:
IgG ELISA,ELISA and VNT,Serology

We don't find igG ELISA in the paper. But we found igM elisa,
the reason why missed it is that it showed up with full name
"immunoglobulin M".

Possible solution: Put full names in our dictionary.
