finalize the functions.

I tried to write the big function to many unit functions.

I got a strange error

```
getSectionText("Andriamandimby-2011-Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic.pdf")
```
output:
Error in findSectionHeaders(doc, ...) : 
  (list) object cannot be coerced to type 'double'


Function was working fine before. The error just pop up.
I tried to reinstall packages "XML" and "ReadPDF", it did not work.

By getting into the function, the problem is caused by
secs = secs[as.numeric(sapply(secs, xmlGetAttr, "rotation")) == 
                    0]

returns a list of NULL's
