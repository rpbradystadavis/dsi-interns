I ran the function findTestInSection() in testBySection.R. and wrote the
ouput to a myTests.csv file (uploaded to google drive).
```
my_tests = sapply(files, function(x) try(findTestInSection(x, RyansDictionary)))
```

Currently, the function only works on the pdf which contains the section
of Method, study design or material and methods.

Observations:
We got many antibodies but it does not appear in the forintern2.csv file.

In PDF Andriamandimby-2011-Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic.pdf
We found ELISA, IGG ELISA, bu there is only virus isolation in forIntern2.csv.
We don't find virus isolation in the paper.
